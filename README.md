# Third-Party-Test-Harness

## Description:
A small Java web application that is used primarily for the use of interacting with CHS services. The testing with this harness focuses on obtaining the correct scopes and permissions that are requested via this web application for use of Companies House Enabled API's
This is an example application of a third party app gaining an Oauth token and using it for access to APIs and displaying the correct scopes.
